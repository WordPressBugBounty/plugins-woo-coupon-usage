== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is a "coupon-based" affiliate plugin for WooCommerce? =
Coupon Affiliates enhances affiliate marketing by integrating coupons as a core feature. Unlike traditional affiliate plugins that rely primarily on referral links, this plugin allows affiliates to share their unique coupon codes. These codes not only track sales for commission purposes but also offer customers immediate discounts or special offers, enriching the purchasing experience. However, the Coupon Affiliates system still maintains the flexibility of referral links; affiliates can share URLs that automatically apply their coupon at checkout, and even if a coupon isnt used, you can still make the link alone track referrals, ensuring affiliates receive credit for every sale referred‚Äã‚Äã.

= What is the difference between the free and pro versions? =
The free version of Coupon Affiliates includes all the basic features you need to create a coupon-based affiliate program for WooCommerce, including an affiliate dashboard, referral URLs, commission tracking, and more. The Pro version adds many advanced features such as multi-level affiliates (MLM), advanced reports and analytics, performance bonuses, commission payouts, custom tabs, and more. You can view the full list of features on our <a href="https://couponaffiliates.com">website</a>.

= What is the difference between the "Affiliate Dashboard" and "Affiliate Portal"? =
The "Affiliate Dashboard" is the original dashboard page that is generated by the plugin, which includes all the features and statistics for affiliates. The "Affiliate Portal" is a new, modern alternative to the affiliate dashboard, which offers a full-screen interface that aligns with your brand. It includes all the same features as the affiliate dashboard, but with a more user-friendly design and layout.

= Will this work with my existing coupons and orders? =
Yes, once you install the plugin it will look back at the full order history for each coupon, even those created before the installation, and display the stats for these on the coupon affiliate dashboard too.

= How do the affiliate referral URLs work? =
A referral URL is automatically generated for the affiliate, and can be found on their dashboard. This link can then be shared by the affiliate. Anyone that visits the website using that link, will have the coupon code automatically applied to their account on checkout. Clicks are also tracked, and any sales made via the coupon are tracked as conversions.

= Can I assign affiliate users to coupons? =
Yes, you can assign affiliate users to coupons, which will give them direct access to their affiliates dashboard page, without needing to use a unique link. <a href="https://couponaffiliates.com/docs/assign-users-to-coupons">Click here</a> to learn more.

= What kind of coupon usage statistics are shown? =
On the coupon affiliate dashboard, you (and your affiliates) will be able to see a variety of statistics including total uses, discount type, orders total, amount saved, commission earned, and more. You will also be able to see a recent order table (with general info such as date, order total, discount, products, commission etc), and with the pro version you can see a monthly orders/commission summary table for the past 12 months.

= GDPR & Privacy =
All data used and created by the Coupon Affiliates plugin is stored on your own website. We don't track or collect ANY of your affiliate program data ourselves. You can **optionally** opt-in to share some basic usage data which helps us with providing support, fixing bugs, and improving the plugin, and can also opt-out at any time.

= Will there be more features added in the future? =
Yes! New features are added frequently, most of which are based on feedback. So if you have any suggestions to help improve the coupon affiliates plugin, please get in touch!

= Do you provide support? =
Yes. If you need any help setting up the affiliate plugin, please free to <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woo-coupon-usage/#new-topic-0">get in touch</a> and we'll be happy to help!

= How can I report issues/bugs with the plugin? =
You can report feature bugs by creating a <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woo-coupon-usage/#new-topic-0">support ticket</a>. Please provide as much information as possible to make it easier for us to find a solution for you.
